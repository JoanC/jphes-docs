2. Select a data set to approve, the period(based on the reporting period of the data set) and then Kenya(Represents Mechanism level).

.. note:: If the **reporting organisationunit hierarchy** does not appear on the data approval page. Navigate to **data entry app** and search for any facility on the search menu. Once the hierarchy appears on the data entry screen go back to data approval page, and the hierarchy should appear. *It's an issue of browser caching, to be fixed soon*.
